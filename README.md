# Task 6 – Password Strength Evaluation

This repository contains my work for *Task 6* of the Elevate Labs Cybersecurity Internship, focused on creating strong passwords, evaluating their strength, and identifying best practices in password security.

---

## Objective

> Understand what makes a password strong, test various passwords using a strength checker, and reflect on common attack methods and security practices.

---

## Tool Used

- [PasswordMeter.com](https://passwordmeter.com/) – An online password strength evaluator

---

## Files Included

- password_report.md – Contains password test results, complexity ratings, and lessons learned

---

## Summary of Results

I tested passwords of varying complexity:
- Weak: password123
- Moderate: CyberShepherd2025
- Strong: G@lactic_W4rr10r!
- Very Strong: C0ntR0l+_Alt+_S3cUr3

Each was evaluated for length, randomness, and use of uppercase/lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

## Key Takeaways

- Passwords should be *long, complex, and unpredictable*
- Use of symbols, numbers, and mixed case *increases strength*
- Avoid *dictionary words* or common patterns
- Use *password managers* to generate and store secure passwords
- Always pair strong passwords with *Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)*
