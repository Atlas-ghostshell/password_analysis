#  Password Strength Analysis – Task 6

This report contains the results of testing several passwords with varying complexity levels using the online tool *[passwordmeter.com](https://passwordmeter.com/)*. The goal was to understand what makes a password strong and how password strength impacts security.

## Password Test Results

| Password             | Complexity     | Score (%) | Strength Rating | Notes                                                   |
|----------------------|----------------|-----------|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| password123          | Weak           | 18%       | Very Weak        | Common word + predictable numbers. Easily guessed.       |
| CyberShepherd2025    | Moderate       | 48%       | Average          | Good length, mixed case, but still predictable.          |
| G@lactic_W4rr10r!    | Strong         | 82%       | Strong           | Symbols, upper/lower case, numbers, and good entropy.    |
| C0ntR0l+_Alt+_S3cUr3 | Very Strong    | 100%      | Very Strong      | Excellent complexity with high resistance to guessing.   |

##  What Makes a Password Strong?

A strong password typically has:
- At least *12–16 characters*
- A mix of *uppercase and lowercase letters*
- *Numbers* and *symbols*
- *No dictionary words* or predictable patterns
- Is *not reused* across multiple accounts

---

##  Common Password Attacks

- *Brute Force:* Trying every combination of characters until one works.
- *Dictionary Attack:* Using lists of common words and phrases to guess passwords.
- *Credential Stuffing:* Reusing leaked username-password combos from previous breaches.

##  Best Practices Learned

1. *Avoid predictable words* like “password”, “admin”, or your name.
2. *Use longer passphrases* where possible.
3. *Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)* for added security.
4. *Use a password manager* to generate and store strong passwords securely.
5. *Never reuse passwords* across different platforms.

## Conclusion

Password complexity plays a huge role in defending against attacks. The more unpredictable and diverse a password is, the harder it becomes to crack—whether by brute force or dictionary attacks. Using secure passwords, paired with MFA and good hygiene, greatly enhances your personal and organizational security.
